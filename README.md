# FibonacciSum
## A mathematical approach to finding the sum of N fibonacci terms.
This code is a mathematical approach to finding the sum of n numbers of a fibonacci series. It uses a very clever formula named after Jacques Philippe Marie Binet.
It uses simple exponential functions to determine the approximate value of the sum of a given number of fibonacci terms. 
The math behind this is very clever, and I do recommend [this proof](http://www.milefoot.com/math/discrete/sequences/binetformula.htm) for further understanding of the concept. 


The raw code is free to use for academic or mathematic purpose since this is a simple digitization of Binet's Formula. This was simply a project that I made to challenge myself to make a program for finding out the sum of N terms for fibonacci numbers without using loops.
